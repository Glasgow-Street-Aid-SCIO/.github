We are a recently formed medical street team of First Responders/Clinicians who offer medical assistance (i.e. first
aid, wound care, advice, ongoing medical care referrals) or welfare assistance (i.e. advice, emergency accommodation
support, referral to homeless or council services) to those in need.

We are in the process of recruiting volunteers who can provide software engineering services to us in order to progress
our digital footprint. Our workflows and processes wouldn't be possible without the continued support from the
development community.

Please get in touch if you'd like to volunteer and help us progress satisfy our mission.
